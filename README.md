🚀 The Power of Semantic Kernel in AI Workflows
Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly, and developers need frameworks that can bridge local and cloud models, integrate retrieval pipelines, and scale across providers. That’s where Semantic Kernel shines.
🔑 Key Highlights:
- Connect to Local Models: Seamlessly integrate ONNX, Ollama, and Hugging Face models into your workflows.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhance responses with domain-specific knowledge using RAG plugins.
- Understand AI & LLM Basics: Grasp the fundamentals of Large Language Models and how they power modern applications.
- Semantic Kernel Framework: Learn the core concepts that make it flexible, modular, and extensible.
- Multi-Provider Support: Connect to Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Inferencing APIs, and more — all through one unified framework.
- Model Context Protocol (MCP): Unlock new possibilities by integrating MCP servers, enabling richer context and interoperability.
